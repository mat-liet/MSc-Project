Project for MSc Computer Science at University of Birmingham.

Implementing a Network Intrusion Detection System using Pcap4J. 

Main objectives are:
1) Capture packets from whole network.
2) Check for port scans e.g. XMAS scan, FIN scan, NULL scan etc.
3) Signature search engine. Detects known signatures of intrusion attacks. 
3) Alert and logging system.
